The design files are all the designs that were created throughout the semester for the bands. 
They can be used to understand the dimensions, size, shape, designs/patterns of the bands that we intend on creating. 

It should be noted that all the designs created during this semester were based on estimated sizes of the electronic components (please read report for
further information regarding this).
